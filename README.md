# machine-learning-powered-vertical-autoscaler-via-kubernetes
This project introduces a novel auto-scaling method using machine learning (ML) techniques, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). The ML models are trained on data collected from simulated memory leak scenarios.
